knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data analyses

```{r PCAdapt}
# see 4_pcadapt.R
```

```{r OUTFlank}
# see 11_outflank.R
```

```{r random_forest}
# see 11_outflank.R
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
